## Quick Start Notes:
1. .NET Standard 1.6 compatible library
2. An xAPIWrapper port implemented in C# that can be used to interface with any LRS
3. The library can be used with plafforms that supports the .NET Standard
4. The xAPIWrapper eliminates the need for client/end user to know the internals of the TINCAN specification
5. The xAPIWrapper implemention makes generating statements as easy as adding log statetments to your code
